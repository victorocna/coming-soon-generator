Generates a "Coming soon" page using Webpack & Handlebars.

## Quick start

First, copy the default `.env.example` config into a `dotenv file` and update it based on your project needs.

Run the build command, which will generate the coming soon page in the `dist` folder.

Upload it using your favourite FTP client and enjoy!

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run build
```
